# Weather-App  

This project was created to practice working with APIs.  

It uses three APIs:  
* Openweathermap's Geocoding API  
* Openweathermap's Current Weather API  
* Openweathermap's 3-hour Forecast 5 days API

Demo : https://getter111.github.io/weather-app/ :point_left:

* HTML  
* CSS  
* OpenWeather API  

## Features

* Button to display data in metric or imperial units.  
* Weather symbols for each forecast description.

The free version of Openweathermap API does not always return precise results with the way I designed it. There could be some slight miscalculations in the temperatures and forecast.
